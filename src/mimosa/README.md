This package implements a tightly-coupled multi-modal fusion framework. It currently supports fusing LiDAR (Geometric, Photometric), Radar, any Odometry and IMU to provide robust state estimation in challenging environments. The framework is designed to be modular and easily extensible to add new sensors.

## Working Description

mimosa maintains a sliding window factor graph to fuse factors generated from multiple sensors. On arrival of a new measurement (a pointcloud from the LiDAR or Radar or an odometry message from an external odometry source like VIO), a new state is "declared" in the graph and connected with a preintegrated IMU factor. Then the measurement gets processed by the corresponding sensor manager to generate a new factor(s). This factor(s) is(are) then added to the graph and the graph is optimized. The optimized state is then published on `mimosa_node/graph/odometry` topic as a `nav_msgs/Odometry` message.

### IMU Factor

The IMU factor is based on GTSAM's provided `PreintegratedIMUFactor` but modified to also have gravity as a state in the preintegration. This is due to the fact that we consider the initial orientation of the IMU to be the map frame (whereas GTSAM assumes the map frame to be gravity aligned).

### LiDAR Factor

There are two types of LiDAR factors implemented:

1. Geometric Factor: This factor uses point-to-plane scan-to-map ICP residuals to constrain the LiDAR pose. The correspondences are found using a k-d tree and the residuals are computed using the point-to-plane distance.
2. Photometric Factor (Implemented only for Ouster LiDARs): This factor uses photometric error of patches in the intensity image to constrain the LiDAR pose.

### Radar Factor

The radar factor provides a single factor per pointcloud that utilizes the radial speed residuals from the radar measurements.

### Odometry Factor

Consecutive odometry measurements (e.g., from a VIO system) are used to create relative pose factors (Between factors) between the corresponding states in the graph.

## Setup

These instructions target ROS 2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04. This repository is a complete
colcon workspace and includes its GTSAM, gtsam_points, and config_utilities dependencies.

  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
  rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
  colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
  source install/setup.bash
  ```

## Usage

Run online with the generic ROS 2 launch file and select a sensor profile:

```bash
ros2 launch mimosa mimosa.launch.py profile:=hornbill viz:=true
```

For offline processing, replay a ROS 2 bag with simulated time:

```bash
ros2 launch mimosa mimosa_bag.launch.py profile:=enwide bag_name:=/path/to/ros2_bag viz:=true
```

Available profiles are `enwide`, `euroc`, `hornbill`, `lapwing`, `magpie`,
`newer_college`, and `parrot`. Input topics can be overridden with
`imu_topic`, `lidar_topic`, `radar_topic`, and `odometry_topic` launch arguments.

### Pre-optimization debug states

Mimosa publishes the sensor state supplied to the factor graph before GTSAM optimization on:

- `/debug/imu/state`: the IMU-preintegrated initial state for the new graph state.
- `/debug/lidar/state`: the state at which the LiDAR factors were built and linearized.

Both topics use `mimosa_msgs/msg/FactorGraphState`. The message contains the shared graph-state
index, pose, velocity, accelerometer bias, gyroscope bias, and full gravity vector in m/s². These
topics intentionally contain pre-optimization values; use `/mimosa_node/graph/odometry` for the
optimized state.

Generate an interactive comparison report from a ROS 2 bag containing these topics:

```bash
python3 src/mimosa/mimosa/scripts/factor_graph_state_report.py /path/to/ros2_bag \
  --output factor_graph_report.html
```

When `--output` is omitted, the report is written to `factor_graph_report.html` inside the ROS 2 bag
directory.

The report reads GPS ground truth from `/sensing/gnss/nav_sat_fix` and converts valid fixes to a
local WGS84 ENU frame. It contains one figure for each position axis (`x`, `y`, and `z`) with the
IMU, LiDAR, optimized Mimosa output (`/mimosa_node/graph/odometry`), and GPS traces plus their
corresponding GPS errors. It also contains one figure for roll, pitch, and yaw with the IMU, LiDAR,
and optimized output traces plus their differences against IMU, and an aligned 3D trajectory.
`NavSatFix` has no orientation, so GPS cannot be included in the orientation figures.

By default the script estimates an SE(3) transform from the Mimosa map frame to the GPS ENU frame
without changing trajectory scale, and applies that same transform to the IMU, LiDAR, and optimized
Mimosa states.
Use `--gps-alignment translation` when the frames already have the same axes, or
`--gps-alignment none` when they are already coincident. Use `--gps-max-time-difference` to control
GPS timestamp matching, `--gps-topic` to override the GPS topic, `--odometry-topic` to override the
optimized output topic, `--max-time-difference` to control IMU/LiDAR/output matching, and
`--plotlyjs cdn` to create a smaller report that loads Plotly from the internet.

The report generator is a standalone Python script and does not use ROS Python libraries or require
a running ROS environment. It reads ROS 2 SQLite (`.db3`) and MCAP bags directly. NumPy and Plotly
are required; the pure-Python `mcap` package is additionally required only for MCAP input:

```bash
python3 -m pip install numpy plotly mcap
```

##### [Unified Autonomy Stack Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ntnu-arl/unified_autonomy_stack_datasets)

Download any rosbag from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ntnu-arl/unified_autonomy_stack_datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ntnu-arl/unified_autonomy_stack_datasets). There are two variants of robots in this dataset: one which has an Ouster LiDAR and the other which has a Unipilot module (with a Robosense Airy LiDAR). As per the rosbag that you downloaded, you will need to build the [ouster_ros](https://github.com/ouster-lidar/ouster-ros) or [rslidar_sdk](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/rslidar_sdk/tree/develop) package respectively to be able to convert the raw LiDAR packets to pointclouds. Please follow the instructions in the respective repositories to build the drivers. Note that in the case of rslidar_sdk you will need to modify the config file to set the `lidar_type` as `RSAIRY`, the `common/msg_source` as `2` (for packet message comes from ros or ros2), `send_packet_ros` as `false` and `send_point_cloud_ros` as `true`. You can find a working config file [here](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/rslidar_sdk/blob/d02b59cc43d027e4bdaa1ee0762d36e77129ecc7/config/config.yaml).

The bags should be replayed with `--clock` option and the global `/use_sim_time` parameter set to true. To do this, a simple way is to create a launch file called `simcore.launch` with the following content:

```xml
<launch>
  <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/>
</launch>
```

Then you can launch the system as:

```bash
# Terminal 1
roslaunch simcore.launch

# Terminal 2
roslaunch ouster_ros replay.launch
# or
roslaunch rslidar_sdk start.launch

# Terminal 3
roslaunch mimosa hornbill.launch
# or
roslaunch mimosa magpie.launch

# Terminal 4
rosbag play --clock /path/to/your/rosbag.bag
```

```bash
ros2 launch mimosa mimosa_bag.launch.py profile:=newer_college bag_name:=/path/to/ros2_bag viz:=true
```

##### Complete Dataset Example

There is also a script [dataset_evaluation.py](src/mimosa/scripts/dataset_evaluation.py) that can be used to run the complete dataset evaluation. This script will run the `mimosa_rosbag` node on all the sequences in the dataset and save the results in a folder. Before running this script make sure to set the correct `dataset_path` and `results_directory`. It is assumed that the dataset is in the following format:

```bash
dataset_path/
├── sequence_1
│   ├── xxxxxsequence_1.bag
|   ├── gt-sequence_1.csv
├── sequence_2
│   ├── xxxxxsequence_2.bag
|   ├── gt-sequence_2.csv
├── sequence_3
│   ├── xxxxxsequence_3.bag
|   ├── gt-sequence_3.csv
├── sequence_4
│   ├── xxxxxsequence_4.bag
|   ├── gt-sequence_4.csv
```

```bash
python dataset_evaluation.py
```

### On your own data

To run on your own data, you need to set up the following:

1. Take the most relevant launch file
2. Modify the remapping of the input topics to your sensor topics in the launch file
3. Modify parameters in the corresponding config file
   1. e.g. for velodyne the `point_skip_factor` must be 1
   2. Set your transforms for `T_B_S` for each of the sensors you are using. This is the transform from the Sensor frame to the Body frame (i.e. pose of Sensor in the Body frame).
4. Launch your launch file
